Today I learned about **[DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com)** — an AI-powered tool that turns any public GitHub repository into interactive, wiki-style documentation.

## 🔍 What It Does

- 📚 **Automatic Docs**: Just paste a GitHub link (or swap `github.com` with `deepwiki.com`) and it generates structured explanations — architecture, modules, dependencies, and more.
- 🗺️ **Visual Diagrams**: View interactive graphs showing how files, classes, and functions connect.
- 🤖 **"Ask Devin" Chat**: Ask natural-language questions like “How do I run this project?” or “What does this function do?”
- 🧪 **Smart Analysis**: Flags issues, suggests improvements, and compares repos in deep-research mode.

## ✅ Why It’s Useful

- Free to use on public repositories — no setup required
- Saves time understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Great for onboarding, research, and documentation

## 🚀 Example

```text
Original: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain  
DeepWiki: https://deepwiki.com/langchain-ai/langchain
```

This shows a clean summary of the codebase, with linked explanations and the ability to chat about specific files or functions.
