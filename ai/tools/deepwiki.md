# TIL: DeepWiki.com

Today I learned about **[DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com)** — an AI-powered tool that turns any public GitHub repository into interactive, wiki-style documentation.

## What It Does

- Automatic Docs: Just paste a GitHub link (or swap `github.com` with `deepwiki.com`) and it generates structured explanations — architecture, modules, dependencies, and more.
- Visual Diagrams: View interactive graphs showing how files, classes, and functions connect.
- "Ask Devin" Chat: Ask natural-language questions like “How do I run this project?” or “What does this function do?”
- Smart Analysis: Flags issues, suggests improvements, and compares repos in deep-research mode.

## Why It’s Useful

- Free to use on public repositories — no setup required
- Saves time understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Great for onboarding, research, and documentation
