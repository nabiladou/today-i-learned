# ⚡ Chaos Testing (Chaos Engineering)

Chaos Testing — also known as **Chaos Engineering** — is the discipline of **experimenting on a system to build confidence in its resilience and fault tolerance**.  
It’s not about breaking things for fun — it’s about **learning how systems behave under stress** and ensuring they can survive real-world failures.

---

## 🧭 What is Chaos Testing?

In modern distributed systems, failures are inevitable — networks fail, nodes crash, dependencies go offline.  
Chaos Testing introduces **controlled faults** in a **planned, measurable way**, allowing teams to:
- Expose weaknesses before they cause outages.
- Improve incident response and reliability.
- Build more resilient architecture.

## 📜 The Chaos Engineering Manifesto

The **Principles of Chaos Engineering** were first articulated by engineers at **Netflix**.  
They describe a systematic approach to injecting failures safely and learning from them.

### Core Principles

1. **Define Steady State**  
   - Identify what “normal” looks like (metrics, SLIs, etc.).

2. **Form Hypotheses**  
   - Predict how the system will behave under specific failure conditions.

3. **Inject Real-World Failures**  
   - Introduce turbulence: kill pods, add latency, block network, etc.

4. **Observe and Measure**  
   - Validate whether the system stayed within its steady state.

5. **Learn and Improve**  
   - Document results, improve design, and repeat safely.

## ⚙️ Common Chaos Testing Tools

| Tool | Description | Suitable Environment |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Chaos Monkey** | The original Netflix tool; randomly terminates EC2 instances. | AWS |

## 🧩 Introducing Chaos in CI/CD

Chaos testing isn’t just a manual activity — it can be automated within your delivery pipelines.

### Steps to Integrate Chaos Experiments:
1. **Staging Before Production:**  
   Run chaos experiments post-deployment in staging environments.
2. **Automate via Pipelines:**  
   Add a “chaos” job in Jenkins, GitLab, or GitHub Actions.
3. **Observe with Monitoring Tools:**  
   Use Grafana, Prometheus, or Datadog to monitor SLIs and SLOs.
4. **Pass/Fail Criteria:**  
   Define what steady state means; fail the pipeline if resilience metrics degrade.
5. **Gradual Rollout:**  
   Start small and move toward automated chaos in production with guardrails.

## 🧠 Theory and Best Practices

- **Start Small:** Begin with small, isolated failures in non-critical systems.
- **Measure Everything:** Metrics and observability are key to learning.
- **Automate & Schedule:** Make chaos testing part of regular operations.
- **Collaborate:** Involve developers, SREs, and ops teams.
- **Document Learnings:** Each experiment should produce actionable insights.
- **Run Game Days:** Organize team-based chaos exercises to simulate real incidents.
- **Build Guardrails:** Always include safe rollback mechanisms.

## 🏗️ Applying Chaos Testing at Work

1. **Define Goals:**  
   What does resilience mean for your system? (Uptime, latency, data integrity, etc.)

2. **Choose a Tool:**  
   - Docker: use **Pumba**
   - Kubernetes: use **LitmusChaos** or **Chaos Mesh**
   - Cloud-native: use **Gremlin** or **AWS Fault Injection Simulator**

3. **Start with Simple Experiments:**  
   - Kill a pod  
   - Add network latency  
   - Shut down a dependency

4. **Measure Impact:**  
   Use monitoring dashboards to ensure your steady state holds.

5. **Iterate and Improve:**  
   Run regular chaos experiments, evolve your incident playbooks, and track improvements over time.
